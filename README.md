## Accessing Staging
- Locally, hit [127.0.0.1/staging](127.0.0.1/staging)
- For the production site, hit [dearborncodingclub.com/staging](dearborncodingclub.com/staging)

## Deploying to Fly.io
We currently use [Fly.io](https://fly.io) run the service.

We deploy the app via GitHub Actions whenever a PR merges into main (points to https://api.dearborncodingclub.com).

 
You can also deploy the application manually by executing `flyctl deploy` from the repo folder, after logging in to an admin account locally (`flyctl auth login`).
- You can install the `flyctl` CLI tool too.

## (Re)generating TLS Certificates
[Fly.io](https://fly.io) handles our TLS certificates as part of their managed hosting service. We have manually generated a Let's Encrypt certificate using:

`fly certs add dearborncodingclub.com`

## Running the application on a different domain
- If you want to run the application on a different domain, be sure to add to the `settings.py` file under `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
